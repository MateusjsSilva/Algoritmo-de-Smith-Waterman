# Smith-Waterman Algorithm

This project implements the Smith-Waterman algorithm used for local alignment of DNA sequences.

## Features

- Reads sequences from an input file.
- Calculates the optimal alignment and the maximum score.
- Writes the aligned sequences and additional information to an output file.
